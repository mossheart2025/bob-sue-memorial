        <h2>A Life of Service</h2>

            <p>Bob and Sue believed that faith wasn't just something you talked about - it was something you lived every day through service to others. Their church, Mt. Carmel, was the heart of their community involvement, and every Wednesday you could find them both working together to prepare God Works meals for those in need. This wasn't just volunteer work for them; it was an expression of their deep faith and their genuine care for their community. They understood that a warm meal could brighten someone's day, and they were committed to making sure their neighbors never went hungry. Their dedication to this ministry showed their belief that serving others was one of the most important ways to serve God, and they approached this work with joy and purpose, side by side.</p>

            <p>Beyond their church service, Bob and Sue were actively involved in their community in countless ways. Bob was a proud member of the Temperance MI OLMC Knights of Columbus, where he emerged as a natural leader, holding both local and state offices for many years. Sue supported him in these endeavors, and together they attended State Conferences on Mackinac Island, where they made lifelong friendships with fellow members who shared their commitment to faith and service. Bob also loved calling bingo and organizing activities that brought people together, always finding ways to create community and connection. Whether it was through their church, the Knights of Columbus, or simply spending time with friends and family, Bob and Sue understood that a life well-lived was a life spent in service to others, and they dedicated themselves to making their corner of the world a little bit better every single day.</p>
