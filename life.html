        <h2>Their Life Together</h2>

            <p>Bob and Sue's love story began at Jefferson High School in Monroe, Michigan. Sue graduated in 1964, and on July 25th of that same year, she married the love of her life, Robert Bomyea, at St. Anne Catholic Church in Monroe. Their journey together started in Klamath Falls, Oregon, where they began building their life as a young married couple. With Bob serving in the United States Air Force, they embarked on an incredible 22-year adventure that took them across the world. Together, they explored various locations throughout Canada, Europe, and the United States, creating memories and experiences that would last a lifetime. These travels didn't just show them the world - they strengthened their bond and taught them to find home wherever they were, as long as they were together.</p>

            <p>Throughout their years together, Bob and Sue discovered shared passions that brought them joy and kept them connected. Golf became one of their favorite activities, with Bob learning to play with just a 5 iron and a putter, and Sue joining him on the course as his favorite partner. Whether they were teeing off together or enjoying the friendly competition, golf was more than just a sport for them - it was quality time spent doing something they both loved. They also shared a love for camping, packing up and heading out to enjoy nature and the simple pleasure of being away from it all. Bob's love for cooking meant that even on camping trips, they enjoyed delicious meals together. Sue brought her own creative talents to their life, making beautiful quilts for their loved ones, crafting jewelry, and using her skills as a tailor to create and mend with care. Together, they built a life filled with adventure, creativity, and most importantly, love.</p>
